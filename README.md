# 🚀 Deploying a Secure Static Website on AWS Using S3, CloudFront, ACM, and GoDaddy  
### A Complete Step-by-Step Guide

Hosting a static website on AWS is simple — but hosting it **securely**, with **HTTPS**, **global CDN caching**, and a **custom domain**, requires a few extra steps.

This repository documents the complete end-to-end process of deploying a **secure, high-performance static website** on AWS using:

- **Amazon S3** — private bucket for hosting static files  
- **Amazon CloudFront** — global CDN for speed & caching  
- **AWS ACM** — free SSL certificates for HTTPS  
- **GoDaddy** — domain registration & DNS management  

This guide follows **AWS best practices**, including **Origin Access Control (OAC)** for secure S3 access.
